Retrieves the outward facing IP address from your Airport Extreme
router, and if it has changed, tell freedns.afraid.org.

By checking your router, it avoids generating any internet traffic
and freedns.afraid.org activity unless your IP changes.

This script has only been tested on MacOS X Lion (10.7) and
Mavericks (10.9) with an Airport Extreme.  If you have any
suggestions on making the script more portable or robust, please
let me know.


Directions:
  0) Adjust PATH if necessary.  No need for MacOS X.

  1) Fill in $dynkey with your dynamic authentication token from
       http://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/ .

  2) Fill in $me with your email address.  You can leave it blank
       if you don't want an email when your IP address changes.

  3) Add an entry to your crontab to run this script periodically.
       Script can run as you.  It does not require any privileges to run.
